## Study Notes

### about_array_assignment

**The splat Operator**

When an lvalue is preceded by an asterisk, all remaining rvalues are placed in an array and assigned to that lvalue

`a, *b = 1, 2, 3`  
`a => 1`   
`b => [2, 3]`

When there are too few rvalues to assign to lvalues, the variable is assigned nil

### about_hashes

**Hash Default Values**

Hashes have a default value that is returned when accessing keys which do not exist. By default this is nil.

**Q: Why would you want to use #fetch instead of #[] when accessing hash keys?**  
A: #fetch raises an exception KeyError if the key does not exist. #[] returns nil.
   Use fetch if you are not sure the key exists and want to return an error if it does not.

`hash = Hash.new('test')`
Sets the default return value to the string 'test'

`hash[:one] = "dog"`  
`hash[:one] => "dog"`  
`hash[:two] => "test"`

### about_strings

**Q: Ruby programmers tend to favor the shovel operator (<<) over the # plus equals operator (+=) when building up strings.  Why?**  
A: << modifies the string in place, whereas += creates a new one. Further explanation here http://library.edgecase.com/a-little-more-about-strings

`1.9.3-p194 :001 > a = "foo"`  
` => "foo"`  
`1.9.3-p194 :002 > a.object_id`  
` => 70283949004920`  
`1.9.3-p194 :003 > a << " bar"`  
` => "foo bar"`  
`1.9.3-p194 :004 > a.object_id`  
` => 70283949004920`  
`1.9.3-p194 :005 > a += " baz"`  
` => "foo bar baz"`  
`1.9.3-p194 :006 > a.object_id`  
` => 70283948969420`  

**Strings can be split using regular expressions**

`a = "the:rain:in:spain"`  
`a.split(/:/)`  
`=>  ["the", "rain", "in", "spain"]`

### about_symbols

to_s is called on interpolated symbols.

Symbols stay in memory until the program exits.

### about_regular_expressions

A failed match returns nil.

Regular expression operators are greedy. As many occurences as possible are matched while still allowing the 
overall match to succeed. A greedy metacharacter can be made lazy by following it with a ?

The left most match wins  
`"abbcc az[/az*/]"`  
`=> "a"`

`#select` invokes the block for each element and returns an array of the original elements for which the block returns true

`["cat", "bat", "rat", "zat"].select { |a| a[/[cbr]at/] }`  
`=> ["cat", "bat", "rat"]`

`\w` - Any word character. a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore. No spaces allowed.  
`.` - period is any non newline character.

Capital negates. `\W` - not a word character. `\D` - not a digit.

A regular expression can be assigned to a variable.

```grays = /(James|Dana|Summer) Gray/  
"James Gray"[grays]```  
`=> "James Gray"`

**scan = find all**  
**sub = find and replace**  
**gsub = find and replace all**  

### about_methods

`eval` takes a string and executes it as code  
`eval("Time.now")`

The context which code is executed in is called a binding.

The last thing to be evaluated in a method is returned.

When return is used in a method, only the object it specifies is returned, even if it is not the last.

```ruby
def method_with_explicit_return 
  :a_non_return_value
  return :return_value
  :another_non_return_value
end
```  
```ruby
method_with_explicit_return => :return_value
```

A variable args method returns an array and is of class Array.

Inside a class def creates a new instance method.  
When self is used inside a class, a new class method is created.

**Private and Protected Methods**

Calling private methods with an explicit receiver raises NoMethodError.  
This includes using self from within other methods of the class and when trying to use the method on an instance of the class

### about_constants

Top level constants are referenced by double colons

```ruby
CONSTANT = "woof" 
  class Dog

    CONSTANT = "bark" 

    def self.sound
      puts C
      puts ::C
    end
  end
```
```ruby
Dog.sound =>
"bark"
"woof"
```

Nested classes inherit constants from enclosing classes. Subclasses inherit constants from parent classes.  
Lexical scope = static scoping

TODO: Read about nested and lexical hierarchy scope

### about_control_statements

All statements in ruby return the value of the last expression evaluated.

**Ternary Operator**

If true, return :true_value else return :false_value  
```ruby
true ? :true_value : :false_value
```

```ruby
unless true   # the same as saying if !true
```

`p foo` does `puts foo.inspect`, printing the value of inspect instead of to_s, making it more suitable for debugging.

### about_true_and_false

nil is treated as false

Everything else is treated as true: 0, 1, [], {}, "Strings" and "".

### about_triangle_project

In ruby, it is invalid to do `a == b == c`. The closest equivalent is `a == b && a == c`

The most elegant solution:  
* Put the sides of the triangle in an array
* Use uniq to remove all sides from the array which are not unique in size
* Use size to find out how many sides are left in the array
* If all sides match, 1 will be returned. If 2 sides match, 2 is returned.

```ruby
def triangle(a, b, c)
  case [a, b, c].uniq.size
  when 1 then :equilateral
  when 2 then :isosceles
  else        :scalene
end
```

### about_exceptions

In Ryan Davis' Ruby Quickref, he says   
> 'donâ€™t rescue Exception. EVER. or I will stab you.' http://www.zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/QuickRef.html#general-tips

This post at Stackoverflow explains why http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10048173/why-is-it-bad-style-to-rescue-exception-e-in-ruby

This is because Exception is the root of ruby's exception hierarchy. When you rescue from Exception, you rescue from everything, including subclasses such as SyntaxError, LoadError and Interrupt.

Some examples of why this would be bad are:

* Rescuing Interrupt prevents the user from using Ctrl-C to exit the program.  
* Rescuing SyntaxError means that `eval`s that fail wil do so silently  
* Rescuing SignalException will prevent the program from responding to signals. It will be unkillable except by `kill -9`

You should handle only exceptions that you know how to recover from.

`raise` and `fail` are synonyms.

The format of writing code which may raise an exception:

```ruby
begin
  # something which might raise an exception
rescue SomeExceptionClass => some_variable
  # code that deals with some exception
rescue SomeOtherException => some_other_variable
  # code that deals with some other exception
else
  # code that runs only if *no* exception was raised
ensure
  # ensure that this code always runs, no matter what
end
```

### about_triangle_project_2

To pass this test, an error must be raised when:

* The triangle has zero or negative length sides
* The sum of the two shortest sides is not greater than the longest side

```ruby
def triangle(a, b, c)
  # sort the sides by shortest length to largest
  a, b, c = [a, b, c].sort   

  # Raise an error if the length of the shortest side is zero or less
  raise TriangleError, "A triangle's side cannot be 0 or have a negative length" if [a, b, c].min <= 0 

  # Raise an error unless the sum of the two shortest sides is greater than the longest
  
  raise TriangleError, "The sum of two smallest sides must be greater than the largest side" unless a + b > c
  case [a, b, c].uniq.size
    when 1 then :equilateral
    when 2 then :isosceles
    else        :scalene 
  end
end
```
